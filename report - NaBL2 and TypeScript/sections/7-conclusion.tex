\section{Conclusion}

We have seen how structural types in TypeScript work as opposed to more common nominal type systems.

The definition of TypeScript and ECMAScript 2015 syntax with SDF3 is relatively straightforward
and even offers some improvements compared to the official ECMAScript 2015 specification.

Our attempt to model structural types with NaBL2 was met with more challenges.
Our efforts resulted in the insight that one pass of constraint generation and constraint solving
is not powerful enought to support structural and recursive types.

We have proposed the addition of custom relation definitions to allow language designers to define their own
subtype relations.
With this extension and two new constraints, \texttt{forall} and \texttt{exists}, language designers will 
be able to model more complex and diverse type systems.
As an example we have demonstrated that the proposed constructs can be used with Scope Graphs to model 
TypeScripts structural types, including unions and intersections.
